This is the README for your project. If you choose to publish an open source `app`
for this project, this is what will be displayed on [Autocode Apps](/app).
**The first line** will be used as the title of the app. Otherwise, you should use it
to record important information about the project for yourself or your teammates.

## Preview
While in the Autocode Editor, you can see a small preview of your README
in the bottom right corner. Click on it to expand the preview.

## GitHub
Should you decide to publish your projects and templates to GitHub,
you can include an **Open in Autocode** button as displayed above.
This will enable anybody to fork your project in Autocode directly.

# Inspiration
When I first entered a discord channel, I was surprised to see so many features in a social media platform where you can not only chat but also use customized voice channels, give roles to the users, and make different channels for specific purposes, etc. 
       Out of all these one thing that caught my eye was the discord bot, where you can use the bot to automate things like replying to the user, assigning roles to the user, bot which helps to control spam, music bot etc. 
  
# What it does?
In this project I tried to make a Discord Music Bot where I used message.create.prefix from autocode and using the prefix command allows the user to control the music- !play, !stop, !resume, !pause, !queue.
Challenges I ran into?
Initially, it was a little bit difficult for me to understand the code as I was going through the autocode documentation. Their codes like 
let searchString = message.split(' ').slice(1).join(' ');  
const lib = require('lib')({token: process.env.STDLIB_SECRET_TOKEN}); (Adding the note packages)

# Accomplishments that I am proud of
Now I can understand how a discord bot works and use different API to complete my project

# Whatâ€™s next for Symphony-Bot?
In the future, I will be adding features like showing the music queue list, Singer, and Composer of the music. Also, I will add the features of fetching all the notifications of email, and to-do list, add voice recognition features like Alexa or Siri, etc.
